# SQLAlchemyLibrary for Robot Framework

SQLAlchemy Library contains utilities meant for Robot Framework's usage. This can allow you to query your database after an action has been made to verify the results.

This is a fork of [Robotframework-Database-Library](http://franz-see.github.io/Robotframework-Database-Library/) that uses SQLAlchemy Core instead of directly using the Python Database API.
